# Contributing
A few guidelines for contribution.
## Opening an Issue
If you have found a bug or have a feature idea, make sure it hasn't been either fixed or reported already. If it hasn't been fixed or reported yet then create a new issue that explains the problem and provides a bit of background and steps to reproduce it if possible.
## Submitting a Pull Request
- Try to keep pull requests small
- Add a description as to what you fixed/changed
